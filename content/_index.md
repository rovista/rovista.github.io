## RoVista 

RoVista measures the RoV filtering ratio of network operators. This ratio is derived from our measurement technique that uses (1) in-the-wild invalid BGP Prefixes and (2) IP-ID side-channel technique. The details will be published soon.

The table below shows the ROV filtering Ratio based on our most-recent snapshots. Please click the ASN to see its historical pattern of ROV Ratio.

The detail information of vantage points we used for the measurement will be available soon.
